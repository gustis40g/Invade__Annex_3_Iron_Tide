//-------------------------------------------------- Rules

player createDiaryRecord ["rules", ["Player Report", "
<br/>If you see any player breaking the rules and you can`t find an admin in-game or on Teamspeak, please use the following procedure:
<br/>1. Go to forums.ahoyworld.net
<br/>2. In navigation menu look for Player Tools button, it opens a drop-down menu
<br/>3. Select Player report option
<br/>4. Fill in a player report, be honest and provide enough evidence
"]];
player createDiaryRecord ["rules", ["Enforcement", "
<br/>The purpose of the above rules is to ensure a fun and relaxing environment for public players.
<br/>
<br/>Server rules are in place merely as a means to that end.
<br/>
<br/>Guideline for enforcement:
<br/>
<br/>-	Innocent rule violation and disruptive behaviour:
<br/>
<br/>		= Verbal / Written request to cease, or warning.
<br/>
<br/>-	Minor or first-time rule violation:
<br/>
<br/>		= Kick, or 0 - 3 day ban.
<br/>
<br/>-	Serious or repetitive rule violation:
<br/>
<br/>		= 3 - 7 day ban.
<br/>
<br/>-	Administrative ban (hack/exploit/verbal abuse/serious offense):
<br/>
<br/>		= permanent or 30 day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>The above is subject to discretion.

<br/>This is a short summary of the rules.  The full rules can be found <execute expression='call rules'>here</execute>.
<br/>Or alternatively at: http://www.ahoyworld.net/index/rules/
<br/>But the first link is always up to date while the second might not be
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Short summary of the rules:
<br/>
<br/>-AhoyWorld is a welcoming community that respects its members and visitors. We expect everyone to maintain this environment and will take action against those who jeopardise that community spirit. Admins reserve the right to warn/kick/ban users whose behaviour is deemed disruptive or aggressive and not conducive to a place of tolerance/friendship/comradery. Whether the behaviour is disruptive or not will be determined on a case-by-case basis on the judgment of the admin/admins present.
<br/>
<br/>-Racism or hate speech of any kind is not tolerated.
<br/>
<br/>-Do not intentionally kill another player on your side.  If you accidently teamkill someone, apologize immediately.
<br/>
<br/>-Play the mission as intended.
<br/>
<br/>-Consider your skill as a pilot before taking a Pilot slot.
<br/>    -The primary role of a pilot is to provide logistical support to the infantry on the ground.  Examples of logistical support are: transporting people, ammo, fuel, vehicles, â€¦
<br/>    -In case of poor ability, a pilot may be asked to leave the slot.
<br/>
<br/>-Play your role.
<br/>    -If you are operating a support asset like a mortar or a CAS plane/helicopter you are not allowed to kill the entire AO.  Support assets are there to support the infantry this means that infantry must call these support assets in.
<br/>
<br/>-Do not waste assets.
<br/>
<br/>-Respect game immersion.
<br/>    -Refrain from spamming the side global and command chats.  Ask yourself if what you have to say is useful information for everyone.  It might be more sensible to use group, vehicle or direct chat.
<br/>    -Do not talk in global, side and command channels.  Use group, vehicle and direct chat for voice communications.
<br/>    -Playing music in global, side, command and group channels is forbidden.  You may play music in direct and vehicle channels, unless another player asks you not to.
<br/>
<br/>-Trolling in any way will be dealt with swiftly and harshly.
<br/>
<br/>-Being AFK for prolonged periods of time in the server is not acceptable.
<br/>
<br/>Upon entering an AhoyWorld invade and annex server you agree to abide by the following rules.  Any breaking of the rules can result in sanction being applied by a member of staff.  These sanctions can include, but are not limited to, warning, in-game punishment, kicking, temporary ban and permanent ban.  Which action should be taken will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the staff member(s) present at the time and left to the discretion of this/these member(s) of staff.

player createDiaryRecord ["faq", ["UAVs", "
<br/><font size='16'>Q:</font> Can I use the UAVs?<br/>
<br/><font size='16'>A:</font> Yes, however you must be in the UAV Operator role and you must have a UAV Terminal.
<br/>
<br/><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why do I get the don't troll hint when using my UAV?<br/>
<br/><font size='16'>A:</font> Because our base protection is a bit too eager to stop trolls, until we can come up with a fix for this you'll have to sit somewhere outside of base protection.
<br/>
<br/><font size='16'>Q:</font> Why can't I connect to the UAV?<br/>
<br/><font size='16'>A:</font> Sometimes the UAVs are still connected to the prior Operators Terminal. If he disconnects or dies, sometimes the Terminal does not delete properly. The only solution at this time is to destroy the UAV, and you yourself must respawn.
